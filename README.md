# A SUBSCRIPTION CASE STUDY (FULLY IN EXCEL)

## ⭐ Project Overview
This project evaluates the viability of introducing a 7-day subscription model as an alternative to an existing 30-day subscription product. The analysis examines customer payment behavior, revenue trends, and engagement patterns to determine whether a shorter billing cycle can strengthen cash flow and improve renewal discipline, or whether it creates additional operational and customer behavior risks.

## 🎯 Stakeholder Needs
The business required insights on:
- Average payment delay under the 7-day model.
- Forecasted revenue for January of the following year.
- Average monthly revenue per customer.
- Strategic recommendation on whether to adopt the 7-day subscription.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset included:
- Customer ID
- Payment Dates (DD/MM/YYYY format)
- Amount Paid
- Multiple transactions per customer
- 6-month period: **July – December**
Key context:
- These customers previously averaged 8 days payment delay on the 30-day product.
- **“Payment delay”** = days between expected renewal date and actual payment date.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
This project was completed fully in Excel, using:

**Power Query**
- Cleaned data
- Standardized dates
- Generated expected renewal dates
- Calculated payment delays
  
**Excel Functions**
- UNIQUE() — count distinct subscribers
- FORECAST.LINEAR() — revenue forecasting
- SUMIFS() — monthly revenue calculations
- AVERAGE() — average monthly revenue per subscriber
  
**Pivot Tables & Charts** for trend insights and visual storytelling
  
Assumptions:
- Payment delay is a primary behavioral KPI for subscription reliability.
- Revenue changes reflect subscription behavior, not external factors.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query
- Pivot Tables
- Forecasting (FORECAST.LINEAR)
- Excel formulas for modeling & aggregation
